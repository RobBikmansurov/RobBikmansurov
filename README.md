### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 As a cool IT professional with extensive experience in system development, I was the CIO, the team lead and the system architect, I have been solving business problems through information technology for many years. I have experience of managing a team.
 
 Now I'm open to interesting remote work (relocation is also possible) in a small cool team in complex projects with advanced processes as a Ruby backend developer.
